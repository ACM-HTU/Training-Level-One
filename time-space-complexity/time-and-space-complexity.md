# Time and Space Complexity
## Understanding Algorithm Efficiency in Competitive Programming
Time and space complexity are crucial concepts in competitive programming. They measure the efficiency of algorithms and ensure they stay within the required limits. Let's explore time and space complexity, provide examples, and learn how to calculate them.

Time complexity refers to the approximate time taken by a program to execute code. It's measured as the number of steps an algorithm takes relative to the input size. Big O notation is commonly used to express time complexity, representing the upper bound of operations as the input size grows. For example, a nested loop (loop inside another loop) with n iterations has a time complexity of O(n*n) which equals O(n^2).

Space complexity refers to the memory space used by an algorithm, including input values. It's measured in terms of memory units required. Similar to time complexity, space complexity is expressed in Big O notation. Though less critical in competitive programming due to generous space limits, interviews often prioritize solutions with minimal space complexity.

To calculate time complexity, count the number of operations an algorithm performs.
For space complexity, determine the memory space needed for variables and data structures.

In competitive programming, understanding time and space complexity is essential to avoid exceeding limits. By developing algorithms with lower complexity, we can efficiently solve problems while using fewer resources.
